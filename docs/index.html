	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

    <p>In this project, we are attempting to implement the effects of iridescence due to the wave of nature of light. As a base for our code, we utilized
        our project 3-2's code, more specifically part 2: microfacet materials. Our goal is to make a material that simulates a thin layer on top of the object
        that not only directly reflects light, but also allows for ray to permeate it and bounce within it before being reflected. These waves interfere with 
        each other both constructively and destructively, causing changes in the color reflected that lead to the rainbow effect we see in iridescent objects.
    </p>

	<h2 align="middle">Implementation and problems</h2>

    <p>Through our research, we discovered that iridescence is commonly implemented from a microfacet BRDF base code by modifying the Fresnel term of the 
        equation. Since we implement microfacets during project 3-2, we decided to use that code as a base for our implementation. However, since neither
        pairs that make up our group implemented that part of the project for the submission, we started off our project by going back to project 3-2's spec
        and implementing microfacets from scratch. Thankfully, it was relatively simple to implement, and so we were able to start developement of iridescence.
    </p>

    <p>We based our implementation of iridescence on past work done on this course, more specifically https://sydnie-shea.github.io/iridescentFinal/ and 
        https://kwsong.github.io/cs184_final/final.html, which already contain a lot of the mathematical formulas that we use in our code. Since iridescence is 
        wavelength-dependent, we calculated the output of the R, G and B channels separately and added them together for the final output. As stated in the 
        microfacet spec, the accurate way would be to account for all wavelengths of light, but for simplification we will only be sampling these three channels.
    </p>

    <p>As stated before, thin film materials reflect light directly, but some of the rays end up permeating the material and bouncing within it before being
        reflected. This means that we have to take more materials into account and their respective refraction indexes, more specifically air, the thin film,
        and the object's base material. Since there is refraction involved, we also had to determine the refraction angles from when the ray permeates the 
        thin film, and the angles they leave the material and are reflected back to the scene. We then used Fresnel equations to determine the transmission 
        and reflected amplitudes of both spectral and polarized light, which are later combined in the final output. We also had to calculate the phase changes
        of the wavelengths, since they interfere with each other. Once we have the amplitudes and phase changes of each wavelength, we are able to calculate an
        estimate of the total transmitted intensity and finally, the final reflectance.
    </p>

    <p>While we followed the formulas as best as we could, we still have not been able to properly implement iridescence, although we believe we are close. 
        The images below show our current progress. As you can see, the output images look oversaturated, looking either too red, green or blue. We are not completely 
        sure what has lead to these results, but we believe it may have something to do with either the eta and k values of the microfacet material of the 
        dae files and how we account for them in our calculations or some error related to our calculations of incoming and outcoming angles. We are currently 
        focused on debbuging and looking at other implementations of iridescence in order to figure out what could be wrong in our code.

    <h3>Last minute update</h3>

    <p>By examining the dae files of the renders above, we noticed that in each of the super-colored objects, the eta value for the respective wavelength of
        the oversaturated color was significantly lower than the others. By changing those values so they matched each other more closely, we were able to
        render more accurate images. The sphere below originally had eta values of around 1.3 1.0 0.6. By changing the last value to 1.6 instead, the render
        looks as follows. However, we noticed that when setting these values to all match at 1.3, the render looks all black with no perceptible iridescence. 
        When we attempted to modify the dragon's values in a similar way to 1.2 for all wavelengths, the render seemed quite matte with no shine, although that
        happens with any rendering of the dragon, regardless of eta values, and we have no idea why it is behaving like this. Adjusting these values for the 
        bunny also seemed to significantly improve the renders.

    <p>We were worried that the iridescence effect we see on the bunny could be simply a reflection of the red and blue walls, so we also decided to test
        rendering bunny_microfracet_cu.dae, and the results look promising.
